Body Mass Index (BMI) is a measurement of a personâ€™s weight with respect to his or her height. It is more of an indicator than a direct measurement of a personâ€™s total body fat.
BMI, more often than not, correlates with total body fat. This means that as the BMI score increases,so does a personâ€™s total body fat.
